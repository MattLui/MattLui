## üëã Hi, I'm Matt!

I am a full-stack software engineer experienced in JavaScript/Node.js, TypeScript, React, Golang, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, AWS, and other tools.

I am currently seeking my next role and am passionate about solving complex problems, crafting elegant solutions, and contributing to impactful projects.

Most recently, I built [Snowclone](https://snowclone-base.github.io), an open-source backend-as-a-service that streamlines the process of provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure for the deployment of realtime-enabled web applications. You can read our in-depth technical case study [here](https://snowclone-base.github.io/casestudy/introduction/)!
